      Sinatra Skeleton Help
      ===
      What is this?
      ---
      A simple help file rendered in Markdown.

      But Why?
      ---
      Just because.

      Honestly, the real reason is to bring in the README.txt file contents and display them where
      you can see them in your app so that you can access them at any time during development.
